## Relational Operators

- `==` is the equality operator. This returns true if both the operands are referring to the same object, otherwise false.
- `!=` is for non-equality operator. It returns true if both the operands are referring to the different objects, otherwise false.
- `< `is less than operator.
- `>` is greater than operator.
- `<=` is less than or equal to operator.
- `>=` is greater than or equal to operator.

### Examples

Operator == equal to <br/>
If topScore (100) is equal to 100

    int topScore = 100;
    if (topScore == 100) {
        System.out.println("You got the high score!");
    }

Operator != not equal to <br/>
If topScore2 (100) is not equal to 99

    int topScore2 = 100;
    if (topScore2 != 99) {
        System.out.println("You got it!");
    }

Operator > greater than <br/>
If topScore3 (100) is greater than 99

    int topScore3 = 100;
    if (topScore3 > 99) {
        System.out.println("Yes!");
    }

Operator >= greater than or equal to <br/>
If topScore4 (100) is greater than or equal to 100

    int topScore4 = 100;
    if (topScore4 >= 100) {
        System.out.println("Yes it is!");
    }

Operator < less than <br/>
If topScore5 (100) is less than 101

    int topScore5 = 100;
    if (topScore5 < 101) {
        System.out.println("Hell yeah!");
    }

Operator <= less than equal to <br/>
If topScore6 (100) is less than or equal to 100

    int topScore6 = 100;
    if (topScore6 <= 100) {
        System.out.println("Oh yes it is!");
    }
