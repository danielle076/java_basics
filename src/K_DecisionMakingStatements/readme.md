## Decision Making Statements

Java decision-making statements allow you to make a decision, based upon the result of a condition.

All the programs in Java have set of statements, which are executed sequentially in the order in which they appear. It happens when jumping of statements or repetition of certain calculations is not necessary. However, there may arise some situations where programmers have to change the order of execution of statements based on certain conditions which involve kind of decision-making statements.

We have the following types:
- if then statement
- if then else statement
- switch statement
